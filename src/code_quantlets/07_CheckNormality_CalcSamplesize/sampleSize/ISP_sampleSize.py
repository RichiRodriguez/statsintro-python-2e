""" Calculate the approximate sample size for experiments, for normally
distributed groups, for:
    - Experiments with one single group
    - Comparing two groups
    - with a "two-sided" alternative hypothesis

Note
----
Here the normal distribution is used to approximate the t-statistic,
leading to a small underestimation of the required sample numbers.
